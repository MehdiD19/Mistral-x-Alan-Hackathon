# MISTRAL X ALAN HACKATHON

## 1. Problem Case
Our goal here is to demonstrate how we can inject more medical knowledge into a model (or system!) to improve its ability to answer these questions. We'll use any available open-source resources to achieve this, and weâ€™re excited to see what we can build togetherâ€”let's see if we can outperform the competition! ðŸ˜‰

We have been provided with 103 questions from an exam for French Medical Practice. Each question presents multiple choices, from A through E, and unlike many other benchmarks, the correct answer can involve multiple choices. This means that any combination of the letters A through E (with 31 possible combinations, combinatorics vibes ðŸ˜Ž) could be correct.

Note: We don't have a training dataset with the correct answersâ€”where would the fun be in that? :saluting_face:

The expected format for our submission is a .csv file containing our answers, with the letters for multiple-correct answers being comma-concatenated.

## 2. Solutions
Outline the potential solutions you have identified or implemented to address the problem. Focus on the core ideas and the technologies or methods used.

- **Approach 1:** Explanation of the first solution, including the tools and steps.
- **Approach 2:** Explanation of the second solution, if applicable.
- **Technology Stack:** List the technologies, frameworks, or algorithms used to implement the solutions.

## 3. Challenges
Discuss the challenges encountered during the project. These could include technical limitations, resource constraints, or unforeseen difficulties.

- **Technical Limitations:** Issues related to software, hardware, or design limitations.
- **Resource Constraints:** Time, budget, or team challenges.
- **Unforeseen Issues:** Any unexpected challenges that arose and how you managed
